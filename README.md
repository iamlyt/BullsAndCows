# BullsAndCows

## Overview 

Game that consists of two players: the first player writes a secret code using different digits and letters (depending on what the user inputs/difficulty level desired), and the second player has to guess it. 

At each turn, the second player writes an answer code (0-9, a-z) that they think might be the correct answer. Then, the first player grades that answer using bulls and cows as a notation. If a digit in the given answer matches a digit or letter and its position in the code, it's called a "bull." If a given digit or letter appears in the code but its position doesn't match, then it's called a "cow." The first player reveals how many bulls and cows there are. 

The player wins the game by guessing all the correct numbers and or letters in the secret code.

- Grader
