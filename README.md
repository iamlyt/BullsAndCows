# BullsAndCows

## Overview 

Game that consists of two players: the first writes a secret 4-digit code using different digits, and the second has to guess it. At each turn, the second player writes a 4-digit number that they think might be the correct answer. Then, the first player grades that answer using bulls and cows as a notation. If a digit in the given answer matches a digit and its position in the code, it's called a "bull." If a given digit appears in the code but its position doesn't match, then it's called a "cow." The first player reveals how many bulls and cows there are.
